f = open ("<name>.<document-type>, "<mode>")
Vd: f = open ("khanh123.txt", "w")
--> khanh123.txt in "w" mode (“w” stands for “write”). 
We stored the result of this operation in a file object, f.
Doing this opens the file in write-mode and prepares Python to send data into the file.
"r+" mode will allow you to read and write to it.

f.write()
f.close()
